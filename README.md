# A Rust CAD System

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Michael-F-Bryan/arcs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Michael-F-Bryan/arcs)

([API Docs])

An extensible framework for creating 2D CAD applications, written in Rust based
on an *Entity-Component-System* architecture.

## Project Goals and Milestones

I've broken the direction of this project up into a handful of milestones, each
containing a list of related features or concepts.

- [X] Milestone: MVP
  - [X] Geometry primitives (`Arc`, `Point`, `Line`, etc.)
  - [X] Basic styling component (e.g. `LineStyle` with a colour and stroke width)
  - [X] All drawing objects are attached to a `Layer`
  - [X] Drawing objects have a `BoundingBox` which gets recalculated whenever
        something changes
  - [X] Render drawing objects on a canvas
  - [X] Example showing all of the above and rendering a simple drawing
        ([`render_to_image.rs`](arcs/examples/render_to_image.rs))

- [ ] Milestone: Online demo
  - [ ] Render correctly to a HTML5 `<canvas>`
  - Interactive tools for creating drawing objects:
    - [ ] Point
    - [ ] Line
    - [ ] Arc
  - [ ] Move items between layers
  - [ ] Selectively show/hide layers
  - [ ] `Viewport` panning
  - [ ] Zoom `Viewport` in/out

- [ ] Milestone: Required by Real-World Applications
      (see [`Michael-F-Bryan/rustmatic#38][rustmatic-38])
  - [ ] Robust undo/redo mechanism

- <span id="wishlist">Wish List</span>
  - [X] Z-levels so objects can be drawn on top of each other
  - [X] Entities can be tagged with a name to give them semantic meaning
  - [X] Approximation algorithm
  - [X] Translation algorithm
  - [ ] Uniform scale algorithm
  - [ ] Scaling algorithm without maintaining aspect ratio
  - [ ] Calculate the length of a geometric primitive
  - [ ] B-Splines
  - [ ] Interpolated splines
  - [ ] BÃ©zier curves
  - [ ] Elliptical sections
  - [ ] Closest point algorithm for all geometric primitives

### Contribution

The easiest way to start contributing is to check the issue tracker and look for
an easy issue to tackle. Alternatively [the wishlist](#wishlist) contains a
list of features we'd like to implement, although these may require more effort
or experience.

We're always keen to help mentor contributors!
